# Subthreads

Effective online written conversations can be split into two modes:

1. A main thread with a singular purpose (solve a problem, provide updates, build consensus)
1. Multiple subthreads with more specific focuses that may eventually contribute back to the main thread

This pattern can repeat fractally, based on the complexity of the original main thread and the subthreads it spawns.

The interface for subthreads should emphasize:

- ease of starting subthreads
- summary of activity with a subthread
- ease of contributing back to main thread
- mechanisms for getting new information from the main thread into an old subthread
- relaxed formality within subthreads

Quotes and replies seem like they could assist with the goals here.
