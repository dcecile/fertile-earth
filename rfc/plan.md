Guidelines for managing and organizing work:

- Only open issues for features where there is clear line-of-sight
- When starting work on an issue, write out a rough big picture context inside
  - Start with key outcome from high-level strategy
  - Outline a few steps to connect from this task
  - Call out any special tooling or techniques
- Stick to PRs just small enough to have a material impact or maneuver code toward impact
